- Major publishers only translate **proven hits**, ignoring niche content
- High translation costs create **risk aversion** for experimental series
- **Scanlation** (fan translations) demonstrate massive unmet demand but create legal issues
- Adult demographics (josei/seinen) are **severely underserved**

### Market Evidence
- **France**: Japanese translations = 12.5% of all book translations
- **USA**: Manga now represents **27%** of comic market (up from <5% in 2010)
- **Gen Z**: 34% of US Gen Z identify as "otaku"
- **Digital Dominance**: 78-91% of consumption is digital across all regions

```

**AI-Assisted Pipeline:**
```
Source â†’ AI Translation â†’ Human Review â†’ Digital Release
Cost: $500-1,500 per volume (70% reduction)
Time: 2-4 weeks per volume (80% faster)
```
